                    <p>Hello, my name is Jonas Kwiedor and I am a full stack developer from Hamburg. My passion is programming backends, but sometimes I also have to do frontend...</p>
                    <p>Currently I like to work on snippets, microservices & APIs.</p>
                    <p>As you can see from my repositories on github, I have found open source to be more and more important over the years. Only if developers share their libraries, we can grow faster and create better programs.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4">Programming:</h2>
                    <p>After my training as a media designer, I was looking for a job and tried out a few things. I was doing a lot of frontend at the time. At some point I started to upgrade my skills and did some online courses.</p>
                    <p>I started 100 Days of Code and programmed almost only JavaScript for a hundred days. I also did a small crash course in Python at that time. During this time I also played around with Node.js for the first time and realized how diverse the backend, API & interface world actually is.</p>
                    <p>In the following months I programmed more and more with Node.js and at some point I started to write the whole thing in TypeScript.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime I played around a bit with Deno. At some point I read an article about Node.js vs GO. At first I ignored the article.... Then I read it.</p>
                    <p>Since I was always looking for a fixed language, but Python was somehow not my thing, I decided to take a course in GO Lang. And voila a love was born.</p>
                    <p>Currently I use GO for most of my individual projects. The simple syntax and high performance is just great!</p>
                    <h2 class="text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4">Hobbies:</h2>
                    <p>During the Corona crisis, I was actually able to keep myself busy. This was due to computer games on the one hand and my 3D printer on the other.</p>
                    <p>First I started to download .stl files on thingiverse.com and exported and printed them via my slicer for my printer. Thereby some small figures came around.</p>
                    <p>One day my father needed spare parts for his garden chairs. So I started using Autodesk Fusion 360 to design and print the part.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise I like to program in my spare time or ride my standup board or bike through Hamburg.</p>
                    <p>Recently I started playing Minecraft again. Maybe I will program a plugin with GO or I dare to try Java. We will see it on Github.</p>
